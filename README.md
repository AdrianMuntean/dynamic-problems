# Dynamic programming?

## Def
 1. The pattern of overlapping subproblems.
 2.  Any instanace where the problem can be decomposed into smaller instances of the same problem. 
 3.  An optimization over plain recursion. 

## The idea
The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we don't have to re-compute them
when needed later. This simple optimisation reduces time complexities from exponential to
polynomial
